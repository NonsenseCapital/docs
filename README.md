# Shitpost Capital :poop:

Shitpost Capital is a "proof of concept" decentralized fund based on [Harbour](https://www.harbourproject.io/), [Melon](https://melonport.com/) and [Aragon](https://aragon.one/). The goal is to display how various ethereum-based protocols can be combined to build dynamic and fully functional projects.

## Origin

Shitpost being an homage to those redditors and the community which has grown around them spanning into other social media including twitter.
