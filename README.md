# Shitpost Capital :poop:

Shitpost Capital is a "proof of concept" decentralized fund based on [Harbour](https://www.harbourproject.io/), [Melon](https://melonport.com/) and [Aragon](https://aragon.one/). The goal is to display how various ethereum-based protocols can be combined to build dynamic and fully functional projects.

## Origin

The concept of Shitpost Capital came from the concept of doing the exact opposite of what people talk about on crypto-subreddits, this is where the name too originated. Shitpost being an homage to those redditors and the community which has grown around them spanning into other social media including twitter. 

## Overview

The goal of Shitpost Capital is to be purely governed by its token holders without any interference from outside parties. This requires an active community that is provided the various tools needed to fully run such a system. The voting aspects of the fund will be entirely managed using [Harbour](https://harbourproject.io/), the fund will be a generic [Melonport](https://melonport.com/) where the fund manager is an [Aragon](https://aragon.one/) DAO, this allows us to piece together the various strengths of all these projects and provide a cohesive ecosystem. The connection between the voting-system and the fund will be easily built on top of aragon using their [ACL system](https://blog.aragon.one/introducing-aragonos-say-hi-to-modular-and-extendable-organizations-8555af1076f3). 

### Shitcoins :moneybag:

Shitcoins represent a share in Shitcoin Capital, they can be staked in order to gain voting rights, these rights allow particpants to signal their investment opinions. This allows them to vote on as well as create various proposals. Shitcoins are recieved when a particpant buys into Shitcoin Capital, this is done by paying in a certain amount for which they will be allocated coins at the in proportion to the current value of the fund.

#### Staking :bank:

The staking contract used by Shitcoin Capital will conform to [ERC900](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/910). Most likely the [Stakebank](https://github.com/HarbourProject/stakebank) contracts will be utilized.
